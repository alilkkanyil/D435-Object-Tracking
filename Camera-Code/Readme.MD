## Realsense Circle Detection
Realsense_Circle_Detection.m detects circular objects and finds the distance from the object to the camera in milimeters. The output is displayed on the Command Window of matlab, however all the values are held in variables so they can be used for other purposes. It has an orange RGB color mask because we're working with an orange object. Mask can be removed if needed.

## Instructions
Intel realsense SDK libraries are required to run this script. The wrappers need to be added to MATLAB PATH or be present in the current working directory to run Realsense_Circle_Detection.m. Realsense SDK wrappers can be found [here](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/wrappers/matlab).
